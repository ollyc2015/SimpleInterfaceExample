# SimpleInterfaceExample

A very simple example to show a working demo of how to use an interface class in Android, implemented using Kotlin. 

Interfaces are very useful (Taken from [SO](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2586389/when-should-i-use-an-interface-in-java)): 

Programmers will use interfaces to define an application programming contract (blueprint, interface) which "3rd-party" vendors have to fully adhere and implement. 
This way the endusers can just code against the API contract and easily switch off the concrete implementation "under the hood" without changing the code.
